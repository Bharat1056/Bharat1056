I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in building scalable and distributed systems. My current projects include:

- **AI-Agent Workflow** inspired by n8n using **Node.js**
- **Distributed Storage System** using **Go**
- **Real-time DB** using **Go and bbolt**

I focus on improving my expertise in **cloud technologies**, **backend systems**, **generative AI**, and **frontend development with React**. I am particularly interested in how small design and architecture decisions can significantly impact **system performance** and **user experience**.
